It is an art and scince of healthy living. The word ‘Yoga’ is derived from the Sanskrit root ‘Yuj’, meaning ‘to join’ or ‘to yoke’ or ‘to unite’. As per Yogic scriptures the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness, indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body, Man & Nature. <br>

<button class="accordion"  >What Is History Of Yoga ?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>
    <li>The beginnings of Yoga were developed by the Indus-Sarasvati civilization in Northern India over 5,000 years ago. The word yoga was first mentioned in the oldest sacred texts, the Rig Veda. The Vedas were a collection of texts containing songs, mantras and rituals to be used by Brahmans, the Vedic priests.</li>
    <li>There is no consensus on its chronology or specific origin other than that yoga developed in ancient India. Suggested origins are the Indus Valley Civilization (3300–1900 BCE) and pre-Vedic Eastern states of India,the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE), and the śramaṇa movement. According to Gavin Flood, continuities may exist between those various traditions:

    This dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal.

    Pre-philosophical speculations of yoga began to emerge in the texts of c. 500 – c. 200 BCE. Between 200 BCE and 500 CE, philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge. The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy.</li>

<button class="accordion" >What is yoga and its type ? explain component and its element ?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><li>Yoga is a mind and body practice. Various styles of yoga combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation or relaxation. ... It involves movement, meditation, and breathing techniques to promote mental and physical well-being. There are several types of yoga and many disciplines within the practice.</li>
    <li>The spiritual sense of the word yoga first arises in Epic Sanskrit, in the second half of the 1st millennium BCE, and is associated with the philosophical system presented in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, with the chief aim of "uniting" the human spirit with the Divine spirit. The term kriyāyoga has a technical meaning in the Yoga Sutras (2.1), designating the "practical" aspects of the philosophy, i.e. the "union with the supreme" through performance of duties in everyday life.

According to Pāṇini, the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau ("to concentrate"). In the context of the Yoga Sutras, the root yuj samādhau (to concentrate) is considered by traditional commentators as the correct etymology.In accordance with Pāṇini, Vyasa who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras, states that yoga means samādhi (concentration).

Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a yogi (may be applied to a man or a woman) or yogini (a woman)</li></p>

<button class="accordion" >yoga poses for increasing immunity against covid-19 ?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br><b>Yoga Poses : </b>
   <ul>
       <li>Pranayama</li>
       One of the basic yoga poses, pranayama can act as one of the simplest and effective ways to boost immunity and instil some vigour and positive energy into your body.

Sukhasana and pranayama both promote deep breathing, which alleviates stress hormone, smoothen the heart rate and any nervous distress, all of which benefit immunity.
       <li>Matsyasana</li>
       An immunity strengthening pose, fish pose or matsyasana is an elevated pose which detoxifies you and boosts energy levels. Plus, it can also open up nasal passageways and relieve congestion, which is excellent if you have been feeling under the weather.
       <li>Viparita Karani</li>
       As the name suggests, practising viparita karani, which is more commonly known as the 'legs up the wall' pose forces you to invert and destress. It also boosts nerve connections, improves blood flow and vitalizes your body. It is also said to be good for those suffering from reproductive and fertility problems
       <li>Uttanasana</li>
       Inversion exercises like this yoga pose is a great way to relieve congestion and protect the sinuses and mucus membranes, which are the first form of defence. A pose which requires you to submit to the ground and bend over, it is one of the easiest ways to rejuvenate the immune system.

<button class="accordion" >What Is scientific reserach on yoga benefits ?</button>

Relieve low-back pain and neck pain, and possibly pain from tension-type headaches and knee osteoarthritis.<br>Systematic review has found strong evidence for beneficial effects of yoga as an additional therapy on low back pain and to some extent for psychological conditions such as stress and depression, but despite repeated attempts, little or no evidence for benefit for specific medical conditions.</p>
